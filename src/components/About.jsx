          I'm a Computer Science and Engineering student at Vignan Institute of
          Technology and Science, passionate about technology and
          problem-solving. My fascination with computers began at a young age
          through video games, sparking my curiosity about how machines process
          complex tasks. During my Intermediate years at Sri Chaitanya Junior
          College, this interest deepened, leading me to pursue Computer
          Science. With a strong foundation from Yara International School
          (CBSE), Iâ€™m eager to innovate, build, and contribute to the tech
          world. Letâ€™s create something amazing! ðŸš€
